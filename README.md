# OFUFLIX

OfuFlix is a movie streaming platform developed using TypeScript and React Native.

## Getting Started

>**Note**: Before proceeding, make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions up to the "Creating a new application" step.

### Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript bundler that comes with React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the root of the React Native project:

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# Using Yarn
yarn start
```

### Step 2: Launch Your App

Run Metro Bundler in its own _terminal_. Open a new terminal from the root of the React Native project and run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

#### For Android

```bash
# Using npm
npm run android

# Using Yarn
yarn android
```

#### For iOS

```bash
# Using npm
npm run ios

# Using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your app shortly in the _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_. Make sure you have correctly installed your emulator/simulator.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from Android Studio and Xcode.

### Step 3: Edit Your App

Now that you've successfully run your app, let's make some edits.

1. Open the `App.tsx` file in your preferred text editor and make some changes.
2. **For Android**: Press <kbd>R</kbd> twice to see your changes or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on Windows and Linux, or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> on macOS)!

   **For iOS**: Press <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in the iOS Simulator to see the changes and reload the app!
